## My process

I started out with building the site by using html, css and vanilla javascript but i was not able to do the the filtering part and also the listing part was very repetitive. To tackle this problem i came to know about react and freshly building up the app.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

I learned

- how to filter elements by catagory.
- how to filter by search query.
- how to traverse through nested objects and arrays.

### Continued development

I will exploring more on react and get a good grip on it.

### Useful resources

- [React](https://react.dev/) - This helped me to set up react on my local machine.
